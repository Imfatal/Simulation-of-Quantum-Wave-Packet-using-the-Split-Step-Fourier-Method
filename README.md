# Simulation-of-Quantum-Wave-Packet-using-the-Split-Step-Fourier-Method
Studying the time evolution of a quantum mechanical wave packet using Hamiltonian dynamics, deriving the numerical formulation of the split-step Fourier method for solving the time- dependent Schrodinger equation and implementing the split-step Fourier algorithm to simulate wave packet propagation in one-dimensional potentials.
